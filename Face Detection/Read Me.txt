#Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV
This code demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar cascades. The script captures frames from a webcam, detects faces in each frame, and draws rectangles around the detected faces.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV

#Usage
Clone the repository or download the script directly.
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python face_detection.py
A new window will open, showing the real-time video stream from your webcam with rectangles drawn around detected faces.
Press the 'q' key to stop the program.

#How It Works
The script loads the Haar cascade XML file for face detection using cv2.CascadeClassifier.
It initializes the webcam using cv2.VideoCapture.
Inside the main loop, it captures frames from the webcam using video_capture.read().
The frames are converted to grayscale using cv2.cvtColor.
Faces are detected in the grayscale frames using faceCascade.detectMultiScale.
For each detected face, a rectangle is drawn around it using cv2.rectangle.
The processed frame is shown in a new window in real-time using cv2.imshow.
Pressing the 'q' key terminates the program.
